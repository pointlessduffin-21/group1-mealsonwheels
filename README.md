# group1-mealsonwheels

## Project Background
The "Meals On Wheels" project aims to develop an enterprise application for MerryMeals, a charitable organization. MerryMeals provides hot lunch meals to adults who are unable to cook for themselves due to age, disease, or disability. During weekdays, if the members are within 10-km radius from the outsourced kitchen, they will be provided with a hot meal. Otherwise, they will be provided with a frozen meal. During weekend, frozen meals will be delivered to the members regardless of the distance from the outsourced kitchen. The project focuses on designing software that facilitates member and caregiver registration, partner and volunteer registration, fundraising, menu planning, meal delivery management, food safety, needs reassessment, and management information systems.

The project is being developed by a team of full-stack web developers at Unity One Solutions. The team's responsibilities include creating a software design document, conducting a feasibility study, performing risk analysis, and developing a test plan. The tools and technologies used include Visual Studio Code, PHPMyAdmin, Laravel, Spring/Spring Boot, React, Angular, Apache Tomcat, and MySQL Server.
